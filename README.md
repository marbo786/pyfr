1. Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to design an intelligent, interactive dashboard for sports data analysis that integrates regression-based machine learning techniques and a natural language chatbot interface. Key goals include:
- Enabling users to upload and analyze custom sports datasets.
- Applying regression techniques to make predictive insights (e.g., player performance, match outcomes).
- Integrating an AI chatbot to facilitate natural language querying and interaction.
- Ensuring the system is generic and can work with various types of sports data.
- Creating a user-friendly GUI using the Dash framework.
2. Methodology

The methodology comprises the following components:
• Data Collection & Processing:
  - Datasets will be sourced from platforms like Kaggle and sports APIs.
  - The system will support CSV uploads with preprocessing features including handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
• Regression Modeling:
  - Implement multiple regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso) to predict outcomes such as player scores or match results.
  - Evaluate models using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R².
• Dashboard (Dash):
  - Users upload datasets and select features to analyze.
  - Display visualizations like bar charts, line plots, and scatter plots.
  - Allow model training and prediction directly from the UI.
  - Provide interactivity using sliders, dropdowns, and other input widgets.
• AI Chatbot Integration:
  - The chatbot will understand queries like 'Show top scorers last season' or 'Predict goals for Player X'.
  - It will interact with both the regression model and the dashboard backend to fetch and respond with relevant data.
3. Expected Outcomes

• A complete, interactive sports analytics dashboard built using Dash.
• Regression models capable of making predictions based on user data.
• AI chatbot integration enabling natural language interaction with the dashboard.
• Export options for saving analysis results or visual reports.
• A system adaptable to multiple types of sports datasets.
